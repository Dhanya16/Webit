<p>Having joined the 232 Mahila Battalion of CRPF during her one-year training course, she requested her seniors to allow her to serve under the male battalion either in an extreme left-wing state, J&K, or the North-East front areas. Not one to shy away from a difficult situation, she has, time and again proved her mettle.</p>
<p>Hailing from a Gurugram-based family with ties to the CRPF, where her grandfather and father were ex-personnel, Usha said that the villagers feel comforted by her presence.In a report published in the Hindustan Times, she says, “I talk to the women. They are scared of male cops and officers. But with me, they are more relaxed.”With the passion and dedication that she brings to the job, it is no surprise that she has been nicknamed ‘Lady Singham’.</p>
